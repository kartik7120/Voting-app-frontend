A voting app build using MERN stack

I found idea for this app from this [Github repository]("https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas");

*Create a poll, Share with friends . Unlimited Polls - Unlimited Votes*

- A app where a user can Create polls and vote on polls 
- Each user should be authenticated to vote on polls
- Links of the Polls create by the user can be shared using various social media platforms like FaceBook, WhatsApp etc
- Users can also see the polls created by them in the Profile page
- All the data of the polls and the user is stored in the database
