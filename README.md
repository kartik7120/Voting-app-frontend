A voting app build using MERN stack

I found idea for this app from this [Github repository]("https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas");

- A app where a user can Create polls and vote on polls 
- Each user should be authenticated to vote on polls

- Users can also see the polls created by them in the Profile page
- All the data of the polls and the user is stored in the database
